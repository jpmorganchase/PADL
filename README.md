# PADL 
## Customized & Efficient ZK toolkit for Private and auditable Ledger

PADL is based on zero-knowledge proofs for inter-parties framework for exploring applications for financial institutes. Padl utilises Sigma Protocols and range proofs on homomorphic multi-asset ledger with smart-contracts capability to verify transactions on chain.

## Env for Private Auditable And Distributed Ledger
- Padl includes rust lib 'zkbp' wrapped in python, so can be used directly as a python package for using crypto primitives and proof generations. 
  Rust implementation is highly based on secp256k1 from ZenGo-X/curv and bulletproofs as well as extended ZKP with sigma protocols+range proofs.
- Padl Smart-Contracts developed in solidity based on ECC for deployment on evm network, providing fast proofs verification for multi-assets tx and implementation of padl-private token.


### Env. Prerequests
1. python > 3.8 and Rust.
2. For testing on smart contracts: `nodejs`, and for local evm testing env., for example ganache-cli, OpenZeppelin contracts such as ERC20.

### Padl Installation
3. run `python setup.py init`

## openzeppelin-contracts
To run the example padl_deployERC.py, need to run `python setup.py contract` to download the openzeppelin-contracts library.

## Run python `serv.py` under the dictionary `PADL\cloud_server\python_storage`


See more examples (pyledger/examples), and tutorials under (./tutorials).
