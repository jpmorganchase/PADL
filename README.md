# PADL extension to Bn254 using Ark-bn254 lib
## Customized & Efficient ZK toolkit for Private and auditable Ledger

PADL is based on zero-knowledge proofs for inter-parties framework for exploring applications for financial institutes. Padl utilises Sigma Protocols and range proofs on homomorphic multi-asset ledger with smart-contracts capability to verify transactions on chain.

## Env for Private Auditable And Distributed Ledger
- Padl includes rust lib 'zkbp' wrapped in python, so can be used directly as a python package for using crypto primitives and proof generations. 
  Rust implementation is highly based on secp256k1 from ZenGo-X/curv and bulletproofs as well as extended ZKP with sigma protocols+range proofs.
- Padl Smart-Contracts developed in solidity based on ECC for deployment on evm network, providing fast proofs verification for multi-assets tx and implementation of padl-private token.


### Env. Prerequests
1. python > 3.8 and Rust.
2. Smart Contracts to be added.
### Padl Installation
In new python env. Run "pip install -e . init" and "python setup.py init"
